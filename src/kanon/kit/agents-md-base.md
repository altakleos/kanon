## Contribution Conventions

- **Commit messages** — prefer [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) prefixes (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`). Convention only, no CI gate.
- **Changelog** — append every user-visible change to `## [Unreleased]` in `CHANGELOG.md` in the same commit that introduces it. Don't batch at release time. Refactors, internal tests, and docs-only edits don't need a changelog entry.
- **Version references** — always write pre-release versions in full (`v0.1.0a9` or `0.1.0a9`), never the bare suffix (`a9`). A bare suffix is a PEP 440 pre-release marker that attaches to any `X.Y.Z`.
