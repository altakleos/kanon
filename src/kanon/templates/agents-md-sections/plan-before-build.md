## Required: Plan Before Build

For any non-trivial change, your **first output** is a plan file under `docs/plans/<slug>.md`, followed by explicit user approval. You may not call Edit, Write, or mutating Bash on source files before the user has approved the plan.

A change is **non-trivial** (plan first) if any of these apply:

- touches more than one function, file, or public symbol
- adds, removes, or pins a dependency
- changes a CLI flag, public schema, JSON/YAML shape, or protocol prose
- warrants a CHANGELOG entry
- multiple agents will collaborate on it
- you are unsure which side of this line it falls on

A change is **trivial** (act directly, no plan needed) only if:

- typo in a comment or string literal
- fixing a single failing assertion with an unambiguous fix
- renaming a local variable
- deleting code the caller can prove is unreachable

**Before your first source-modifying tool call, state in one sentence:** "Plan at `<path>` has been approved." If you cannot truthfully emit that sentence, stop and plan. This sentence is the audit trail — its absence in a transcript is how violations get caught.

**Retroactive plans are evidence of past violation, not a norm.** Do not add to that pile.
